## Description

This project is a password generator that takes specific criteria and turns them into a password. 
- Length
- Lowercase
- Uppercase
- Numeric
- Sepcial

It creates randomized passwords that are very secure and impossible to guess.

I learnt a lot about recursion and randomising in a loop.

## Usage

To use the application, you start by pressing the "generate password" button in the middle of the screen.

This then asks for the criteria of the password while keeping your password secure. (making sure certain criteria are met)

The password will be displayed in the text box above the button.
